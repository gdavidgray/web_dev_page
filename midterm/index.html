      <p>Hiroshi Yoshimura was a Japanese musician and composer who pioneered Japanese ambient music in the 1980s.
        Yoshimura's music is apart of the genre kanky≈ç ongaku, or environment music.
        This style is characterized by light electronic melodies used along side sounds of nature.
        Hiroshi Yoshimura was at the forefront of environment music but his name and music never reached a wide audience during his lifetime.
        His songs could be heard at art gallaries, musuems, and train stations as background music for those passing by.

         However, 14 years after his death his music began to pop up online.

         Through the power of YouTubes reccomendation algorithm Yoshimura's work began to reach people and people really liked it.
         Yoshimura's work gathered millions of veiws leading to a resurgence in Japanese environment music. His music is now widely available online and two
         of his albums have been re-released on music streaming platforms. Yoshimura's music almost lost to history is now met with critical aclaim. His albums
         have been featured in Pitchfork and The Times and his album Green was deemed the most essential Japanese ambient album by Cracked Magazine.
