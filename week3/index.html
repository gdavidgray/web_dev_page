    <h1>As We May Think</h1>

    <p class="quote"> "The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability; and something is bound to come of it."</p>
    <p class="quote"> "The advanced arithmetical machines of the future will be electrical in nature, and they will perform at 100 times present speeds, or more.

    <p>Veneer Bush understood that scientists’ ability to innovate and improve our existence was contingent on the systems in which they were able to access information. It is amazing that he also realized what the inevitable progress in those systems of consuming and storing information would be. I was blown away by the detail to which Bush was predicting the functions of what he called a memex but what we'd call computers. Bush explained computers down to the exact details of how someone would go about using them, for example, he explains how someone may search for a book digitally, flip through its pages, and immediately return to it’s cover with a touch of a button. Reading his predictions my mind was transported to a time when computers were not around. From the perspective of someone in this time these predictions sounded incredible. Now using computers that are more powerful and have more uses than anything Bush could have predicted, I completely overlook how extraordinary these machines are.</p>

    <h1>Long Live The Web</h1>

    <p>Berner-Lee seems like an optimist and a person who believed in the web's ability to get better. For that reason it is really upsetting to see the ways in which we have failed to improve the web. Net neutrality in the US was repealed (hopefully this will change), “walled gardens” feel larger and more controlling, and some governments are restricting people's access to the web. So much has changed since 2010 and I am curious how Berner-Lee feels the web needs to change moving forward.
